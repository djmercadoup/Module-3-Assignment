The R script run_analysis.R was created. The code did the following:

1. Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Added a new variable for the descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Created a second, independent tidy data set (meandt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

A codebook is also provided to explain details of the data analysis.
